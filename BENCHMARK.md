# Git throughput provided by the tool

This document provides a benchmark to show what is the current reachable throughput provided by the tool.

## Hardware

This benchmark has been run on a MacBook Pro with 2.3 GHz Intel Core i5 and 16 GB 2133 MHz LPDDR3

### Results

The tests has been run against Gerrit 3.0, running on localhost and on Gerrithub.

#### Localhost

* Repo size: 100Kb
* Protocol: HTTP

| #Users   |      Command  |  #req/min |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| 1   | clone | 174 |
| 10  | clone | 174 |
| 100 | clone | 174 |
| 1   | push  | 150 |
| 10  | push  | 266 |
| 100 | push  | 269 |
| 1   | fetch | 177 |
| 10  | fetch | 183 |
| 100 | fetch | 185 |

#### Gerrithub

##### No virtualization

* Repo size: 300Kb
* Protocol: SSH 

| #Users   |      Command  |  #req/min |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| 1   | clone | 61 |
| 10  | clone | 67 |
| 100 | clone | 67 |
| 1   | fetch | 60 |
| 10  | fetch | 61 |
| 100 | fetch | 61|

##### Docker

* Repo size: 300Kb
* Protocol: HTTP
* Docker instances: 2

| #Users   |      Command  |  #req/min |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| 3   | clone | 232 |

* Repo size: 300Kb
* Protocol: HTTP
* Docker instances: 3

| #Users   |      Command  |  #req/min |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| 3   | clone | 350 |

##### Notes

* The aim of this quick benchmark wasn't to measure the exact throughput of the tool, but it was just meant to give a rough idea
of what is the possible number of requests
* Different protocols and repo size where used for the 2 environment, this doesn't make the results comparable, but, again, this wasn't the
aim of this benchmark
* Gerrithub.io had a peak of 2 git upload pack per second in the last month, but the average was way lower

##### Conclusions

It seems like running the load test from different docker container helps in increasing the requests throughput.
With 3 docker containers running the tests concurrently from the same machine we managed to get to 6 git-upload-pack per second.

It is probably worth investing some time in running the load tests and collecting the metrics in Docker in an easier way.
